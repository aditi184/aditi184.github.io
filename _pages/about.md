Hi! I'm Aditi, a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at McGill University and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en" target="_blank">MILA – Quebec AI Institute</a>, advised by <a href="https://sivareddy.in/home.html" target="_blank">Prof. Siva Reddy</a> and <a href="https://gfarnadi.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Golnoosh Farnadi</a>.
 
I believe AI becomes truly transformative for all only when state-of-the-art capabilities are democratized across the full diversity of human languages, cultures, and modes of interaction. Motivated by this vision, my research focuses on understanding and advancing the scaling of multilingual and multimodal models across heterogeneous human data.  More recently, I have been studying expert specialization and capacity allocation in Mixture-of-Experts models for multilingual and multimodal settings.

Before starting my Ph.D., I spent two years at Microsoft in the Turing Team, working with <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/monojit-choudhury/" target="_blank">Prof. Monojit Choudhury</a>. There, I worked on ethical reasoning and pluralistic human-values alignment in LLMs, contributed to building <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Bing Copilot Chat</a>, and trained state-of-the-art Visual Document Understanding models.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at <span style="color:rgb(1, 17, 74);">Microsoft</span>, <span style="color:rgb(1, 17, 74);">Amazon</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(1, 17, 74);">Siemens</span>, working on various aspects of building and deploying real-world machine learning systems, and received the <b>Best Bachelor's Thesis Award</b> for my work on scaling Graph Neural Networks 🏆.

If you are interested in similar research directions or would like to explore potential collaborations, feel free to reach out via <a href="mailto:aditi184@gmail.com">email</a>. For more details about my background and prior work, please see my CV.


<!-- on human-values alignment, ethical reasoning, value pluralism and foreign language effect in large language models (LLMs). I also contributed to building Bing Copilot Chat, focusing on conversation quality evaluations, developing and training next user message suggestions models, and worked on training of the state-of-the-art Visual Document Understanding model at Microsoft Turing. Before joining Microsoft, I completed my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. -->

<!-- My research interests lie in making language technologies more representative and adaptive to the complex interplay of languages and cultures. I aim to develop inclusive AI systems that equitably serve diverse global populations. I am also interested in plurastic human values alignment in LLMs. Additionally, I am passionate about expanding the general capabilities of language and multimodal models. -->
